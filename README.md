# MinimalDiscordOverlay
A small discord overlay that quickly tells you if you are voice connected and muted.

Requires that fullscreen applications be run in borderless windowed mode in order to see the overlay. 


# Release Installation instructions
Download the latest version (0.1.0 at time of writing) and unzip the files to the desired directored.

Run "main.exe". A black eye icon should appear in your tray, and two grey squares should appear in the top left.

Right click on the eye icon, and click "Log In". Then, input your Discord username and password. If the login is successful, the squares should change color from grey to red (or green if you're in a voice channel already).
