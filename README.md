# MinimalDiscordOverlay
A small discord overlay that quickly tells you if you are voice connected and muted.

Requires that fullscreen applications be run in borderless windowed mode in order to see the overlay. 


# Release Installation instructions
Download the latest version (0.1.0 at time of writing) and unzip the files to the desired directored.

Run "main.exe". A black eye icon should appear in your system tray (bottom right), and two grey squares should appear in the top left.

Right click on the eye icon, and click "Log In". Then, input your Discord username and password. If the login is successful, the squares should change color from grey to red (or green if you're in a voice channel already). 

You can also change how the overlay displays in settings. Currently, you can just choose the x and y offsets, as well as the square sizes. This information will be stored in config.ini, and can also be edited from there.
